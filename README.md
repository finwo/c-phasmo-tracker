# Stream Companion

This project is a streaming tool to self-host things like overlays that are
commonly used, like a chat overlay and shoutout player.

There will off course be some extra tools specific to my use-case.

## Download

Head over to the [release page][tag-edge] to download the pre-build version for
your specific OS. If a suitable executable isn't listed there, you're free to
try if it works by building it yourself, but keep in mind that no guerantees are
given about whether or not it works in any version.

## Building

This project relies on the [dep package manager](https://github.com/finwo/dep)
to manage it's dependencies.
